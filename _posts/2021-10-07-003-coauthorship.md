I am always a bit gleeful when academics publish about their own. In this case, it's about the _Strategic Management Journal_.
I love this journal but have been warned multiple times that it is very...well, cliquey. This is all of academia though.
I also love looking at the visualization of network dynamics. For my thesis, I had to do 'snap shots' like Koseoglu did.
Here he chunked the data into phases (he didn't explicitly say how),

What is interesting is that he says,

>Fig. 4 presents the evolution of scale free networks for each period. These networks were fragmented, scattered, and less connected; hence, they are not small world networks. However, the all period network (1980â€“2014) had a mean distance of 5.05, indicating that information needs to flows an average distance of six to transfer from one author to another, the path length was not short, and the cluster coefficient was 0.13, reflecting a weakly clustered network and a relationship between SM authors that was not close. This did not exactly reflect the characteristics of a small world network.

This made me do a double take between the viz of network (which is 1980 to 2014) and what was written.
To my (then) untrained eye, this definitely looked like a small world already. And there was nothing to compare it to, what would a small world network look like in this context?
He does say straight away, that when looking at degree distribution, that the network does come "closer to the properties of a small world network".
Which makes sense.

The act of snapshotting dynamic networks in academia is always interesting. I used particular events as triggers for network change.
Koseoglu (2014) does prepend his viz with a discussion on the surge of members in _SMJ_. Time to find a newer network viz to see what it looks like now.
