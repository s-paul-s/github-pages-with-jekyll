I haven't quite recovered from my 100 k word thesis, so here is a visualization of a multi-level network by [Lazega (2020)](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/348638258_Visualizing_Multilevel_Networks_for_the_Analysis_of_Superposed_Levels_of_Collective_Agency),

Lazega (2020) writes,
> "This is the inter-organizational network in which the ties are economic relationships (business deals) signed at time _t_ between companies (the nodes). The pattern represents a core-periphery structure. [...]

> The periphery is composed of many small companies (the nodes on the outer upper circle) that did not sign any contract that year and thus find themselves isolated, as if they were watching the action from a balcony."

The actors (nodes) are at a trade fair and the point he makes is that "social relationships are not only between buyers and sellers, but among buyers and among sellers" (Lazega, 2020, p.3).
In other words, insert you favourite Mean Girls reference here...
What I like about this visualization is that the remark about watching from a balcony is so accurately portrayed in the visualization.
That is, the visualization itself communicates as well as, if not more, than the text.
